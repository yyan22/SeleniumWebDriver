Testing Environment:
1. Programming language: Java.
2. IDE: Eclipse with Selenium WebDriver set up properly.
3. Browser: Firefox.

All these 4 classes are from the same package named automationFramework:

(1) OnlineStorePage.java:
This is the basic class for page objects pattern.

(2) SubmitOrderTestCase.java:
Submit an order for an Apple iPhone4s 16GB SIM-Free - Black (known issue with State drop-down, selecting Country is adequate) and verify the Total Price: given is correct (assume shipping cost is correct based on your choice). You may assume prices shown on product pages are the correct price. 
(3) UpdateAccountTestCase.java:
Verify updating your account details is saved and retrieved after logging out and back in using the My Account link. 

Please note: This test case has not been implemented. The reason it is not implemented is because I registered online but have not received any confirmation email. As long as I get the link to login, I will work on this test case immediately.

(4) EmptyCartMsgTestCase.java:
Verify removing all items from your cart produces an empty cart message.
