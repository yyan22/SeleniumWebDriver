1. Fails to test when user does not have permission to add or modify recipients.

2. Test dependency: should test canReceiveMessage(message, currentUser, recipient) before test add(message).

3. assertEquals(messages.size(), 2) will always return true, which has nothing to do with asserting we pass two messages to the function. 
Instead, it should be like: assertEquals(successfulMessages.size()+failedMessages.size(), 2).

Other test scenarios include:

1. Test when message exceeds limits.

2. Test when empty message is sent.
